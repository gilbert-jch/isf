BDIFFMIN is a Matlab function that computes the B-differential of the
componentwise minimum of two affine vector functions. To achieve this
task, BDIFFMIN uses the Matlab function ISF, which determines the
chambers of an arrangement of hyperplanes having the origin in common.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description of the functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The B-differential computed by BDIFFMIN is a concept of derivative for a
nonsmooth function. The function considered by BDIFFMIN is the
componentwise minimum of two affine vector functions: x -> min
(Ax+a,Bx+b), where A and B are mxn real matrices, while a and b are real
vectors of size m. In this case, the B-differential is a finite (between
1 and 2^m elements) collection of Jacobians (i.e., mxn matrices). The
computing time is polynomial per computed Jacobian.

To realize this task, BDIFFMIN calls the Matlab function ISF (for
Incremental Sign Feasibility), which has been designed to determine the
chambers of an arrangement of hyperplanes having the origin in common.
The sign vectors computed by ISF can be used to solve a number of other
enumeration problems such as

- determining the signed feasibility of a strict inequality linear
  system,
- listing the orthants encountered by the null space of a matrix,
- itemizing the pointed cones generated by a set of vectors and their
  inverses,
- giving the bipartitions of a finite set of points that can be
  separated by an affine hyperplane,

and many others.

Directory content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This directory contains the codes ISF and BDIFFMIN described in the
documentation ./doc/doc.pdf. This one can also be found on Hal
(https://hal.science/hal-04102933).

Here is a description of the contents of its directories:

- data/ contains data for running the solvers,
- doc/ contains the documentation of the solvers IFS and BDIFFMIN,
- res/ contains some outputs of the solvers on the data given in the
  directory 'data',
- src/ contains the source of the solvers.

README-MPC provides a description of how to assess the numerical results
presented in the paper 'On the B-differential of the componentwise
minimum of two affine vector functions' by J.-P. Dussault, J.Ch. Gilbert
and B. Plaquevent-Jourdain to appear in 'Mathematical Programming
Computation'. This is required for a submission to that journal. The
paper is available on http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-04048393. The
Matlab scripts certify_*.m have been designed for that purpose.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage
^^^^^
To use BDIFFMIN or ISF, you should have the possibility to use Matlab
(the code may also work with GNU Octave, but has not been tested with
that programming language).

Then, place the ISF directory somewhere in the Unix hierarchy, say in
isfdir and add the instruction

   addpath('isfdir/src');

in the script/function that will use ISF. See the documentation in the
directory 'doc' for more indications.
